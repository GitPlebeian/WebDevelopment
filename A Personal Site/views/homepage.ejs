          <p>Hello people, I’m Jax Tubbs and I like building websites for people. My hobbies include bouldering, riding my motorcycle (1997 Honda Magna), and messing around with new web design ideas. I am very passionate about web development/design and It is one of my favorite things to do right next to riding my motorcycle. I believe that designing a perfect website is art mixed with code and the results are amazing.</p>

          <p>I can build a fantastic well optimized website from the ground up. The websites I design are custom made and designed by me (No premade themes). All services I can provide are up to date and incorporate all of the best modern coding and design practices. All websites are built from a mobile perspective first then scaled appropriately to desktop size screens to make sure that all content fits perfectly on a small smartphone screen. Check out my skills and services and see if you’re interested in hiring me to build your online presence with a beautiful website.</p>

          <p>What is are the benefits of having a website?
            <br>
            <br>

Inexpensive Advertising: Advertising your business through printed media, radio, or television is very expensive. Some sort of advertising is a must for a growing business and getting a website is very cheap compared to conventional advertising. If some hungry person looks up food in the area on google maps, google maps will prefer to show restaurants that have websites over those that don’t.
            <br>
            <br>
Information Exchange: Having a website is convenient for customers to look at your products online rather than having to go into your store to see your products or services. 
            <br>
            <br>
Credibility: Trust is key with customers and a website can prove that you deserve their business. Having a website helps show the fact that your business is trustworthy and brings your company into the big group of trusted businesses.
