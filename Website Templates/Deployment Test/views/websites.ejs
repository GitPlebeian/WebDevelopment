        <p class="textCenter">This is going to be the page where I have different STYLES of websites. The one I am using for this site is a framework of my design. Im very proud of my framework. I put a lot of work into it and it has taken a long time for me
          to create. I plan to make several slight variations to my framework. It is responsive to if you resize the window you can see that when the window gets too small the navbar will change to look smaller</p>

        <p class="textCenter">This part only works if you are on a laptop or desktop. Basically I designed a grid into my framework. If you resize your window you notice the layout of text changes based off of the width of the window</p>
